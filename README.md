                      Se7en Theme Source Patcher 
                      Script written by: Mr.Fixit

                 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows Se7en Theme Source Patcher v 0.6 Beta Build(2019)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patches your Windows 7 with a resource or icon pack.

There are official 7tsp color packs in development and available to download.
Also several of our users have created custom 7tsp packs which they have made available to the public! 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Patcher will:

1. Extract the selected resource pack to the work folder and looks for each system file this pack will mod. (while patching)

A  backup will be made of those files in the case a backup does not yet exist. 
   If Windows updated a file the backup will be updated as well before (re-)patching the file.

2. The current file ownerships of a file are stored and then administrator ownerships are taken.

3. The file will be patched with the new resources and replaces the original file.

4. The file ownerships and permissions will be restored how they were found the first time the patcher was used. 

It's also possible to create your own custom Theme/Icon pack('s) and apply them with the 7tsp GUI.
Modifications can include icons, bitmaps, a theme, a side panel bitmap, a logon screen, task manager colors and many more.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pack.ini: Some settings explained to create a pack, 
Extract a pack (preferable 7tsp black pack) , replace all or some of the resources with your own and/or just remove any unwanted file or mod...
Re compress the files and folders again as it was with 7zip
and name it "7tsp_my_custom_pack_v0.1.7z"  ("my_custom" can be "any_name" (no spaces))

(Edit and use one of the official 7tsp pack's pack.ini files, do not copy from this explanation)

[Base Pack]
Pack=                  << Name of your custom pack
by=                    << Name of pack creator

                          or "mytheme.theme" (and place the folder that goes with it "mytheme" also in the "Extra" Folder).
                          Any amount of .theme files and corresponding folders can be added to the Extra folder.

uxhex=yes              << In case the theme needs uxtheme.dll to be patched, else write "no".
mui=no                 << Set to "yes" if the pack has any *.mui.res files in the resources folder
os=win7                << Optional if the pack is only for windows 7 to warn windows 8, 8.1 and 10 users


[taskmanager]          << Will only be used if "taskmgr.exe.res" is in the resources folder... (this may also be a 0kb "taskmgr.exe.res" dummy file)
grid=00FF00            << Use any color in hex format
memory=FFFF00

color2=00FF00
color3=0000FF
